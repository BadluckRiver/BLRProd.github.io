		<li>Professional Background</li>
		<p>After High school, BLR joined the military, and worked as a Lab Technician for his duration of his service. <br>
			His first post landed him in the Microbiology field. BLR has been in the Microbiology Research field for almost 10 years. <br>
			While working as a research technician, he realized that it was not truly his passion, and needed to find another career path. <br>
			He spent 5 years in the military, working on a microbiology lab technician, and almost another 5 as a contractor for the same lab. <br>
			He has been published a few times as an author. He has worked with over 100,000 microbiology samples from around the world, testing them for <br>
			identification, and antimicrobial susceptibilities, building a repository for said samples, and cataloging their mutations over time. <br>
			That is a basic summary of his previous professional history. Again, all of this did not continue to spark his interest, so he chose learn <br>
			something else that did.
		</p>
		<li>Educational Background</li>
		<p>With his education benefits, he began to attend school for Digital Media and Web Design, due to his expansive interest in everything <br>
			on a screen. It amazed him how much goes into what someone sees on their computer, mobile, and even tv screen, especially when it comes <br>
			to video games. He has taken courses that expand his understanding on Adobe platforms, video game design, web design, and portfolio creation. <br>
			He has also taken courses within the realm of computer science, such as troubleshooting, networking, and cloud computing. These classes were taken <br>
			to broaden his understanding of the inner workings of his down devices. 
		</p>

		<li>Artistic Background</li>
		<p>Throughout his life, BLR has had more of a creative mind. He loves to take things apart, and piece them back together, bit by bit to see how things work. <br>
			He has also taken art courses to help him with his goals to further create designs, or elements to be viewed on the screen by others. <br>
			As a kid, he loved to draw graffiti, and push his imaginary boundaries by transforming plain text into something less plain. Although <br>
			he has not made graffiti in quite some time, he does view it as an ultimate art form, which many people may not. <br>
			His dream is to one day work on a game he is proud of or has enjoyed throughout his life. An example of that, would be <br>
			Old School Runescape.
