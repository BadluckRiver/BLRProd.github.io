<h3>Completed Projects:
	<ul>
		<li>The Lovely Dry Bones</li>

			</a>
			<figcaption>This is BLR's own rendition of a recreated movie poster for the movie "The Lovely Bones". <br>
				BLR has been a fan of the Super Mario Bros. since he was a child. It was actually the first game
				he ever got his hands on. His father got a Super Nintendo Entertainment System when it came to the US, 
				and BLR absolutely loved it. His intrigue of creating for the screen was born.
				Because of this, he wanted to incorporate Dry Bones into a movie poster that would
				play off of his name. Dry Bones is one of the most iconic enemies in the series. Who better
				to use in the poster?<br>

		<li>The Night Angel Trilogy Movie Poster</li>

			<a href="images/BLR_NightAngelTrilogyPoster.jpg">
			<img src="images/ThumbBLR_NightAngelTrilogyPoster.png" alt="NightAngelPoster" width="100" height="100">
			</a>
			<figcaption>This is a fictional movie poster, created for the book series, "The Night Angel Trilogy" by Brent Weeks. <br>
                	It is one of BLR's favorite book series that has yet to reach a screen, whether on television, or in theatres.
                	Maybe one day it will happen. BLR was not interested in reading growing up, he preferred video games. He felt he
			learned more reading from games, than he could reading a book, due to more intrigue. His first language was spanish, so 
			understanding English texts was not the easiest for him in school. But video games taught him more about the language 
			than any book possibly could. <br>

		<li>BLR at Woodstock of 1969</li>
		<figure class="column">
			<a href="images/BLR_Woodstock.jpg">
			<img src="images/ThumbBLR_Woodstock.png" alt="BLRWoodstock" width="100" height="100">
			</a>
			<figcaption>BLR decided that he wanted to prove he was at Woodstock of 1969. Can you find him? <br>
			Woodstock is one of the most iconic events in history, let alone music festival history. Many people 
			know about it, and some would love to have been there for it. After attending many music festivals in his life, 
			BLR thought it would be a cool project to insert himself into the event, to tell people he was there (jokingly of course).

		<li>Sasuke's Sharingan Evolution (From Scratch)</li>
		<figure class="column">
			<a href="images/BLR Diagram Project.png">
			<img src="images/ThumbBLR UchihaDiagram.png" alt="BLRUchiha" width="100" height="100">
			</a>
			<figcaption>BLR loves the entirety of the Naruto Anime series, and Sasuke is one of the main characters. 
				The concept of the sharingan eye and how it evolves fascinated him, which is why he wanted to recreate
				it for one of his design projects. The sharingan eyes have intricate designs, and the story of how 
				they evolve is a very sad one. The project was to create a diagram of some sort, so an evolution 
				made sense for the assignment. <br>

		<li>EDM Lyfe Magazine Cover (Mockup)</li>
		<figure class="column">
			<a href="images/BLR Magazine Cover.png">
			<img src="images/Thumb BLR Magazine Cover.png" alt="BLRMagCover" width="100" height="100">
			</a>
			<figcaption>BLR has been listening to EDM and Techno music for quite a long time now. He loves
				going to shows, and music festivals, and has said it is the closest place to heaven on Earth.
				For a project, he made a mockup of a fake magazine covering that topic. He would love to 
				some day make music, but that would also be another hobby, Life permitting of course. But 
				going to events to listen to other artists gives him plenty of drive and inspiration for other projects.<br>
