<h3>BLR's Future Endeavor Ideas:
	<ul>
		<li>Content Creation:</li>
		<p>BLR intends to start a youtube channel in the future (Estimated Time Frame: Not yet decided). This channel will<br>
		primarily serve as a hobby project, to catalog his love for video games, and the history of his adventures. Think of it <br>
		as a vintage to modern gaming channel, where he will go back through the catalog of games he has started throughout his life <br>
		but never got around to finishing them. He has a wide array of titles that fit this category, dating all the way back to the Era of Super Nintendo. <br>
		If this sounds interesting to you, please feel free to send a contact to let him know that this is something you would be interested in watching. <br>
		With some support, he will surely be pushed to get it started sooner, rather than later. 
		</p>
		<li>Need Emojis?</li>
		<p>BLR has been viewing content creators for quite a while, hence his desire to start his own channel. He also has had some <br>
			friends start streaming their own content, and he was approached to create emojis for them. It may seem like a small thing, <br>
			but emojis are used in chats more often than actual text it seems. If this is something you are interested in for your own <br>
			creations, or streams and chats, feel free to contact BLR for options and ideas. 
		</p>
		<li>Video Editing (Coming Soon)</li>
		<p>In the same vein as the previous points, BLR would like to begin helping others edit their videos and content, or <br>
		assist with clipping streams to make videos from them for other creators. It will take some practice, but BLR is looking <br>
		to expand his portfolio with more abilities. He has not done video editing in some time, but it may be in the cards for him soon.
